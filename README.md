# spijkstaal-controller
DC motor controller, 3-5KW / 24V

Experimental design for a replacement motor controller for a 1980's Spijkstaal electric vehicle.
This design is made in KiCad

Designed for a 24V Lead-Acid battery and a 3KW, 24V DC motor

Traditional H-bridge design with an Arduino as controlling interface.
The high power print and the controller print are seperate.

Carefull, this is work in progress. As it is now, it's sure to give you 
spectacular fireworks, but no moving vehicle!
